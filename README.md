## Games

### Snake game
[Snake](/snake.py) is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. After a variant has been implemented
 on Nokia phones i 1988. there was a resurgence of interest in the snake concept.In this concept, a sole player attempts to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake longer, so controlling is progressively more difficult. The player loses when
the snake runs into the screen border or itself.
